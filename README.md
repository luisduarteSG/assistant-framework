# Assistant Framework

A Personal AI Assistant framework for developers. 16 first-class `assistant-*` skills: structured workflow, clarification, TDD enforcement, thinking tools, research, security analysis, cross-session memory, documentation generation, codebase onboarding, idea generation, visual diagrams, review automation, skill creation, self-improving reflexion, and purpose-driven context (Telos).

## What it does

1. **Structured Workflow** — TRIAGE > DISCOVER > PLAN > BUILD & TEST > DOCUMENT with approval gates and two-stage review
2. **Clarification** — Converts ambiguous, fragmented, or multi-intent prompts into an executable brief
3. **TDD Enforcement** — Red-Green-Refactor cycle with strict verification gates at each transition
4. **Debugging** — Evidence-first root-cause workflow: reproduce, hypothesize, isolate, fix, verify
5. **Thinking Tools** — On-demand structured reasoning (first principles, multi-perspective debate, stress testing, etc.)
6. **Research Tools** — Tiered information gathering with URL verification and confidence scoring
7. **Security Analysis** — STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP code review, CVE dependency audit, attack surface mapping
8. **Memory System** — Cross-session learning: user preferences, feedback rules, task insights, project context
9. **Documentation** — Auto-generates API docs, architecture docs, README, changelogs, migration guides, code explanations
10. **Onboarding** — Systematic codebase learning: maps structure, identifies patterns, records project context
11. **Idea Generation** — Diverge-converge-refine brainstorming pipeline with codebase awareness
12. **Visual Diagrams** — Mermaid diagrams from code: architecture, sequence, ER, flow, component, class, state
13. **Review Automation** — Autonomous review/fix/re-review loop with confidence thresholds
14. **Skill Creation** — Scaffolds V1 skills with contracts, phase gates, and handoffs
15. **Reflexion** — Self-improving agent: post-task reflection, lesson recall, strategy profiles, confidence calibration
16. **Telos** — Purpose context framework ([Daniel Miessler's Telos Method](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos)): problems, mission, goals, strategies, projects — so agents prioritize work that matters

## Installation

Install all skills for any supported agent:

```bash
./install.sh --agent claude   # → ~/.claude/skills/assistant-*/
./install.sh --agent codex    # → ~/.codex/skills/assistant-*/
./install.sh --agent gemini   # → ~/.gemini/skills/assistant-*/
```

The release inventory is the tracked `skills/assistant-*` set. `skills/unity-*` directories are local-only and ignored by git; they are not installed or validated as framework release skills.

Plugin boundaries are contract-backed in `docs/plugin-architecture.md`. The current installer still uses the root `skills/assistant-*` release inventory by default, and it also supports focused profile installs:

```bash
./install.sh --agent codex --plugin assistant-core
./install.sh --agent codex --plugin assistant-research
./install.sh --agent codex --plugin assistant-dev
```

The repo also includes scaffolded Codex plugin manifests at `plugins/assistant-core/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/assistant-research/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and `plugins/assistant-dev/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. The core scaffold has plugin-local copies of the four core skills, the research scaffold has plugin-local copies of the three research skills, and the dev scaffold has plugin-local copies of the nine development skills. These plugin-local copies are generated release artifacts from the root `skills/assistant-*` source of truth; verify or refresh them with `tools/plugins/sync-plugin-skills.sh --check` and `tools/plugins/sync-plugin-skills.sh --apply`. The installer performs manifest-aware dry-run validation for the core, research, and dev profiles, but the scaffolds are not marketplace-registered yet; root installs remain the compatibility path.

Install a single skill:
```bash
./install.sh --agent claude --skill assistant-thinking
```

Preview without making changes:
```bash
./install.sh --agent claude --dry-run
```

To apply the adaptive Codex routing policy during a Codex install, use:

```bash
./install.sh --agent codex --adaptive-routing
```

This sets the root default to `gpt-5.6-terra` with `medium` reasoning, keeps role-specific baselines in the installed agent definitions, and migrates only the known legacy routing lines in an existing `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. The installer creates one-time `.assistant-framework-adaptive-routing.bak` backups before the local configuration or guidance migration. Restart Codex or open a new task after installation.

On Windows under Git Bash, the installer uses the native `robocopy.exe` mirror operation. Linux and macOS continue to use `rsync`. This avoids the incompatible Git Bash/cwRsync path translation while preserving the same remove-stale-files behavior.

Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI discover and route installed skills through their native skill systems. Codex installs a mandatory, minimal hook profile: every prompt displays the current phase, native subagent start/stop events provide workflow evidence, and standard/strict tasks cannot stop before agent evidence and review are complete. The hooks do not create agents or replace provider-native permissions.

```bash
./install.sh --agent claude
./install.sh --agent codex
./install.sh --agent gemini
```

The Codex installer merges its managed hooks into `~/.codex/hooks.json` idempotently, preserving unrelated user hook commands. Existing `--no-hooks` command lines are accepted only as legacy input and cannot disable this profile.

## Skills

Only tracked `assistant-*` directories are first-class release skills.

### assistant-workflow
Core development pipeline: idea-to-action decomposition, triage, discover, plan, build & test, verify, document.

Loop readiness is conditional. Ordinary day-to-day development, such as taking a work item, prompting once, waiting for implementation, and manually testing the result, stays in the normal workflow. Add `loop_readiness_assessment` only before an explicit repeat, optimization, or experiment loop outside the standard phase gates. Examples include "keep fixing build/test failures until green", "iterate on this interface until the manual checklist passes", or "optimize until a measured target is reached". A loop plan must name the verifier, stop condition, finite max iterations, budget limit, retry/empty-result handling, tool-error handling, low-confidence escalation, rollback/exit action, and harness routing. Loop readiness alone does not require Done Contract, Harness Recipe, Trace Ledger, Replay Packet, Artifact Reference Ledger, or QA evaluation unless harness or QA criteria independently apply.

Triggers on: build, implement, fix, refactor, plan, create, idea

### assistant-clarify
Clarification workflow for ambiguous, fragmented, or multi-intent prompts. Restates the likely goal, surfaces constraints, asks targeted questions, and produces a structured execution brief.

Triggers on: messy prompt, unclear prompt, figure out what I mean, help me structure this

### assistant-tdd
Test-Driven Development enforcement: Red-Green-Refactor cycle with verification gates. Bug fix pattern (reproduce → fix → protect). Integrates with workflow's build loop and review cycle.

Triggers on: TDD, tests first, test-driven, write the test first, red green refactor

### assistant-debugging
Evidence-first debugging: reproduce or bound the failure, rank competing hypotheses, isolate root cause, apply the smallest durable fix, and verify with original reproduction plus regression checks.

Triggers on: debug, root cause, investigate failure, flaky test, failing test, production issue

### assistant-thinking
Six structured reasoning tools: clarify, perspectives, stress-test, deep-think, hypothesize, creative.

Triggers on: think about, clarify, perspectives, stress test, brainstorm, debate

### assistant-research
Tiered research (quick/standard/extensive/deep), five-lens decision briefing, deep investigation, URL verification.

Triggers on: research, investigate, look into, find out, what is

### assistant-security
STRIDE threat model, OWASP code review, CVE dependency audit, attack surface mapping.

Triggers on: security, threat model, audit, vulnerability, OWASP

### assistant-review
Autonomous code review loop: review, fix, re-review until clean or the loop reaches its cap. Prioritizes concrete bugs, regressions, risks, and missing tests.

Triggers on: review, fresh review, code review, review this, check the code

### assistant-memory
Memory management via SQLite-backed knowledge graph (`~/.{agent}/memory/memory.db`). Records rules, preferences, insights, and project context. Survives skill reinstalls. Legacy `graph.jsonl` files are imported or used as fallback seed compatibility only.

Triggers on: remember this, save insight, update memory, preferences

### assistant-docs
Documentation generation and maintenance. Six modes: API docs, architecture overview, README, changelog, migration guide, code explainer. Detects stale docs and offers updates.

Triggers on: document, write docs, update readme, changelog, API docs, architecture doc

### assistant-skill-creator
Creates or updates V1 skills with input/output contracts, phase gates, and handoff definitions following the framework contract guide.

Triggers on: create skill, new skill, add contracts, skill contracts, scaffold skill

### assistant-onboard
Systematic codebase learning for new projects. Six-phase protocol: surface scan, architecture map, pattern recognition, knowledge gaps, record project context, report.

Triggers on: learn this codebase, onboard, get familiar with, map this project

### assistant-ideate
Mode-aware ideation: light mode returns 3-5 quickly ranked options for improvement scans; deep mode runs the full 8-15 idea, weighted-score, refine, and decide pipeline. Codebase-aware ideation scans only the local context needed to shape useful options.

Triggers on: brainstorm, feature ideas, what if, how could we, alternatives, or what-else improvement scans

### assistant-diagrams
Visual documentation from code analysis. Seven diagram types: architecture, sequence, entity-relationship, flow, component, class, state. All output as Mermaid for markdown embedding.

Triggers on: diagram, draw, visualize, show me the flow, architecture diagram

### assistant-reflexion
Self-improving agent loop. Post-task reflection captures what worked and what didn't. Pre-task lesson recall loads relevant lessons from past work. Strategy profiles accumulate per project type. Confidence calibration tracks prediction accuracy.

Triggers on: reflect, what did we learn, lessons, how did that go, calibrate

### assistant-telos
Purpose context framework based on [Daniel Miessler's Telos Method](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos). Guides you through building a purpose chain (problems → mission → goals → challenges → strategies → projects) stored at `~/.claude/telos.md`. Loaded at every session start so agents can prioritize work aligned with what actually matters to you.

Triggers on: telos, my purpose, why am I doing this, what matters most, my mission, update telos

## Tools

### Memory Graph (MCP Server)

The sole persistence layer for cross-session memory. Provides queryable context so the agent can ask targeted questions like "What do I know about the desktop app?" via MCP tools.

**15 MCP tools:** `memory_context`, `memory_search` (FTS5-powered), `memory_doctor`, `memory_add_entity`, `memory_add_relation`, `memory_add_insight`, `memory_remove_entity`, `memory_remove_relation`, `memory_graph`, `memory_reflect`, `memory_decide`, `memory_pattern`, `memory_consolidate`, `memory_stats`, `memory_trend`

Installed automatically to `~/.{agent}/tools/memory-graph/` by the installer. The installer auto-registers the MCP server in your agent settings when `jq` is available. If not auto-registered, add manually (replace `~` with your actual home directory — most MCP hosts do not expand tilde):

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-graph": {
      "command": "~/.claude/tools/memory-graph/run-memory-graph.sh",
      "args": ["--memory-dir", "~/.claude/memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):
```toml
[mcp_servers.memory-graph]
command = "~/.codex/tools/memory-graph/run-memory-graph.sh"
args = ["--memory-dir", "~/.codex/memory"]
```

**Gemini** (`~/.gemini/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-graph": {
      "command": "~/.gemini/tools/memory-graph/run-memory-graph.sh",
      "args": ["--memory-dir", "~/.gemini/memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires .NET 8+ SDK for the initial build (builds automatically on first run). See `tools/memory-graph/DESIGN.md` for architecture details.

### Cognitive Complexity

Roslyn-based analyzer that scores method complexity. Used by the workflow skill's quality review stage. See `tools/cognitive-complexity/`.

### Skill Validator

Source validator for first-class skill metadata and contract structure:

```bash
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh
```

By default it validates only the release inventory: tracked `skills/assistant-*/SKILL.md` skills and their `contracts/*.yaml` files. Local-only `skills/unity-*` directories are excluded by default.

Target a specific skill by name, directory, or `SKILL.md` path:

```bash
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh --skill assistant-thinking
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh --skill skills/assistant-thinking
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh --skill skills/assistant-thinking/SKILL.md
```

Use `--include-local` only when you explicitly want to validate every `skills/*/SKILL.md`, including local-only skill experiments:

```bash
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh --include-local
tools/skills/validate-skills.sh --include-local --list
```

### Skill Evals

Provider-neutral per-skill eval fixtures live at `skills/<skill>/evals/cases.json`
and run locally through `tools/evals/run-skill-evals.sh`:

```bash
tools/evals/run-skill-evals.sh --validate-fixture
tools/evals/run-skill-evals.sh --list
tools/evals/run-skill-evals.sh --emit-prompts /tmp/skill-eval-prompts
tools/evals/run-skill-evals.sh --responses /tmp/skill-eval-responses
```

The default eval inventory is first-class `assistant-*` skills with fixtures and
excludes local-only `unity-*` skills unless `--include-local` is passed. Current
coverage is complete first-class skill coverage for all 16 tracked assistant
skills: `assistant-clarify`, `assistant-debugging`, `assistant-diagrams`, `assistant-docs`,
`assistant-ideate`, `assistant-memory`, `assistant-onboard`,
`assistant-reflexion`, `assistant-research`, `assistant-review`,
`assistant-security`, `assistant-skill-creator`, `assistant-tdd`,
`assistant-telos`, `assistant-thinking`, and `assistant-workflow`. Local-only
Unity skills remain opt-in through `--include-local`. Local grading is heuristic
substring-based checking, useful as a Level 4 conformance proxy but not a
replacement for semantic review. Detailed usage is in `docs/evals/README.md`.

## How it works

### For ideas (vague)
```
You: "I want to add caching to our API"
Workflow skill: Decomposes into 6-8 testable criteria, asks for confirmation, then triages
```

### For tasks (concrete)
```
You: "Fix the null reference in UserService.GetById"
Workflow skill: Triages as Small, quick discovery, lightweight plan, fix + test + self-review
```

### For TDD
```
You: "Use TDD to add a password strength validator"
TDD skill: Activates Red-Green-Refactor. Writes failing test first, implements minimum to pass, refactors, logs each cycle in task journal.
```

### For thinking
```
You: "Think about whether we should use microservices or modular monolith"
Thinking skill: Loads perspectives.md, runs 4-perspective debate
```

### For research
```
You: "Research the best .NET caching libraries"
Research skill: Runs standard-tier research with URL verification
```

### For security
```
You: "Audit the auth flow for vulnerabilities"
Security skill: Loads code-review.md, runs OWASP Top 10 analysis
```

### For documentation
```
You: "Document the API"
Docs skill: Scans endpoints, extracts parameters/types, generates API reference with examples
```

### For new projects
```
You: "Learn this codebase"
Onboard skill: Maps structure, identifies patterns, records project context through the memory graph, reports summary
```

### For brainstorming
```
You: "What are some ideas for improving the search experience?"
Ideate skill: Understands context, generates 10+ ideas, scores them, refines top 3
```

### For diagrams
```
You: "Draw the architecture diagram"
Diagrams skill: Traces code, maps components and dependencies, outputs Mermaid diagram
```

### For self-improvement
```
[After completing a task]
Reflexion skill: Captures what worked, what didn't, extracts lessons for future tasks
[Before starting next task]
Reflexion: Recalls relevant lessons, adjusts plan based on past experience
```

### For purpose alignment
```
You: "telos create"
Telos skill: Walks you through problems → mission → goals → challenges → strategies → projects
You: "Does this task align with my goals?"
Telos skill: Checks active work against your purpose chain
```

## Native skill routing

Each supported agent selects installed skills from the skill name, description, and instructions. Framework contracts, evals, project guidance, and review provide the workflow discipline; there is no separate runtime router or lifecycle enforcement layer.

Workflow metrics are optional, non-blocking observability. Reflexion and memory
capture are also conditional rather than required completion ceremony.

The repository also keeps `triggers:` metadata as explicit examples for documentation and eval fixtures:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "..."
triggers:
  - pattern: "keyword1|keyword2|multi word phrase"
    priority: 80
    reminder: "You MUST invoke the Skill tool with skill='my-skill' BEFORE proceeding."
  - pattern: "another pattern"
    priority: 60
    min_words: 5
    reminder: "Consider invoking my-skill for this request."
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | Yes | Example prompt pattern associated with the skill |
| `priority` | No | Relative specificity used by repository evals and documentation |
| `reminder` | No | Expected routing intent for tests and examples |
| `min_words` | No | Optional example threshold that avoids overly broad fixture matches |

No runtime script changes are needed when adding a skill: add the skill metadata, contracts, and evals, then reinstall.

## Design principles

- **Never guess** — Ask when ambiguous, state assumptions when clear
- **Right-sized ceremony** — Small tasks get lightweight treatment, large tasks get full workflow
- **Composable skills** — Each first-class `assistant-*` skill works standalone or together with the others
- **Progressive loading** — Each SKILL.md is small. Tool files load on demand.
- **Thinking tools are tools, not phases** — Use them when needed, not on every task
- **Memory survives reinstalls** — Data in `~/.{agent}/memory/`, not in skill directories
- **Learning compounds** — Insights from past work inform future decisions
- **Self-improving** — Every task makes the next task better through reflexion
- **Covers weaknesses** — Documentation, diagrams, and onboarding compensate for developer blind spots
