# Workflow Controller

Internal reference for `assistant-workflow` routing and default decisions. This
file centralizes decision boundaries that cut across phase details while
`assistant-workflow` remains the public compatibility entrypoint.

## Controller Role and Non-Goals

- Keep `assistant-workflow` as the only public workflow skill entrypoint.
- Decide the workflow control shape: intensity, harness routing, QA routing,
  movement, role separation, and per-dispatch routing configuration.
- Organize decisions by boundary, not by phase name: routing/defaults,
  movement, harness boundary, subagent/review/QA lanes, and validation.
- Do not redefine phase execution steps, skill contracts, or task packet
  schemas; those stay in `references/phases.md` and `contracts/`.
- Do not create a public `skills/*workflow-controller*` directory or add a new
  triggerable workflow-controller skill.
- Do not replace `references/harness-controller.md`; that file remains
  harness-only.

## Invocation and Loading Rules

- Load this reference from `assistant-workflow` when a task needs shared
  workflow routing or default decisions.
- Use it before phase-specific detail when selecting `controller_intensity`,
  `workflow_state_mode`, `manual_verification_mode`, `learning_capture_mode`,
  `harness_capable`, `qa_evaluation_mode`, movement direction, or review/QA
  ownership.
- Keep the root `SKILL.md` outcome-shaped. Keep phase mechanics in
  `references/phases.md`.
- Do not load `references/harness-controller.md` from this reference unless the
  routing decision has already set `harness_capable=true`.

## Routing Defaults

- `light`: small, low-risk, local work with no public behavior, data, security,
  harness, or QA acceptance risk. It may run inline/direct with relevant
  automated validation and a fresh self-review. Use
  `workflow_state_mode=inline`, `subagent_policy_state=not_required`, and
  `subagent_execution_mode=not_applicable`; do not require Code Writer,
  Builder/Tester, or independent Reviewer dispatch evidence. It does not require
  a journal, metrics, reflexion, memory, or manual verification unless separately
  triggered.
- `standard`: ordinary medium+ source-changing work defaults to
  `controller_intensity=standard`, `harness_capable=false`, and
  `qa_evaluation_mode=not_required`. It requires an approved plan, Build
  verification, and independent review, but no harness or QA ceremony by size.
- `strict`: select only for high/critical risk,
  `harness_capable=true`, `qa_evaluation_mode=required`, trace/replay criteria,
  explicit harness/QA criteria, or explicit strict control.
- Do not infer `strict`, `harness_capable=true`, or required QA from
  size=medium+ or delegation alone.
- Select agents for efficient verified outcomes: use the lowest capability and
  reasoning level that can credibly satisfy the required evidence, and escalate
  when risk, ambiguity, or failed verification proves it is insufficient.
- Before every native dispatch, require the public `agent_routing_plan` from
  `contracts/handoffs.yaml`. Keep requested configuration separate from
  runtime-confirmed effective configuration; a rejected or unavailable override
  must be visible in `runtime_fallback`.
- Treat `harness_capable` as false unless the task is long-running,
  trace/replay-ready, high-risk harness work, domain-scored,
  UI/visual/product/UX/docs/DX-facing, explicitly requested as harness/QA work,
  or already has an accepted Done Contract/Harness Recipe.
- Treat `qa_evaluation_mode=not_required` unless explicit QA/acceptance
  evaluation, accepted Done Contract, harness-capable acceptance scope,
  domain-scored scope, or scoped UI/visual/product/UX/docs/DX acceptance applies.

## Progress Update Policy

Phase checkpoints are required only for `controller_intensity=strict`, explicit
project policy, or a user request. Light and standard work use concise natural
progress updates while still following the same logical phases and applicable
gates.

## State, Verification, and Learning Defaults

- Use `workflow_state_mode=inline` unless state must survive clarification,
  delegation, compaction/cross-session continuation, explicit persistence, or
  strict/harness/required-QA execution. Medium+ size alone does not force a task
  journal; `journal` owns durable state when one of those triggers applies.
- Use `manual_verification_mode=required` only for an explicit request,
  subjective or UI acceptance, external effects, destructive/migration work,
  or inadequate automated verification. Optional steps do not create a wait,
  and user confirmation is not a ritual completion gate.
- Use `learning_capture_mode=auto` normally. The Learning Controller becomes
  required only for explicit `required` mode or concrete review findings,
  build/test failures, user corrections, or memory trend signals. Metrics,
  reflexion, and memory remain optional and non-blocking.

## Move Forward, Step Back, or Replan

- Move forward when required inputs are resolved, the current phase gate is
  satisfied, standard/strict medium+ plans are approved before Build, and the
  next action stays inside approved scope.
- Step back to Discover when an implementation-shaping unknown appears that
  affects correctness, scope, behavior, data, public contract, security,
  migration safety, or verification and cannot be safely inferred locally.
- Step back to Decompose when the slice boundary is broad, not independently
  verifiable, ordered incorrectly, or no longer maps to the artifact contract.
- Step back to Plan when files, behavior, risk, verification, acceptance
  criteria, harness routing, QA routing, or role requirements differ from the
  approved plan.
- Replan when the approved packet is stale, a plan deviation changes scope, a
  Code Writer blocker requires `missing_contract` or `stale_plan` recovery, or
  a pivot/restart decision selects replan.

## Harness Boundary

- This controller only decides whether harness routing applies.
- `references/harness-controller.md` is loaded only after
  `harness_capable=true` is established.
- Do not load `references/harness-controller.md` for ordinary medium work,
  source-changing work alone, delegation alone, generic acceptance labels, or
  optional/not_required QA reasons.
- When harness routing applies, `references/harness-controller.md` owns Done
  Contract, Harness Recipe, and the harness entry gate.
- `references/harness-runtime-artifacts.md` owns Harness Run State, Trace
  Ledger, Replay Packet, Artifact Reference Ledger, pivot/restart details, and
  runtime corrective actions.

## Subagent, Review, and QA Separation

- For standard/strict work, Code Mapper maps context, Code Writer implements, Builder/Tester verifies, and
  Code Reviewer reviews code quality, defects, security, architecture, and test
  coverage.
- Light work implements directly, runs relevant automated validation/tests, and
  performs a fresh self-review without worker or independent-review dispatch
  evidence. Any security, high-risk, harness, or QA trigger promotes the work out
  of this lane.
- Code Reviewer and QA Evaluator responsibilities stay separate.
- QA Evaluator runs only when `qa_evaluation_mode=required`, after build/test
  and Code Reviewer evidence exist.
- QA Evaluator owns acceptance, Done Contract readiness, verification evidence,
  final readiness, and scoped domain quality.
- `reviewer` remains a compatibility route for code review handoffs; it does
  not satisfy required QA Evaluator evidence.

## Validation Expectations

- Contract and eval checks must prove this file exists and is linked from
  `SKILL.md` and `references/phases.md`.
- Contract checks must prove no public `skills/*workflow-controller*` skill
  directory exists.
- Contract checks must prove this reference is decision-boundary oriented, not
  fragmented by phase-name sections.
- Ordinary medium checks must preserve `controller_intensity=standard`,
  `harness_capable=false`, and `qa_evaluation_mode=not_required`.
- Harness checks must prove `references/harness-controller.md` stays
  harness-only.
- Generated plugin mirrors must come from
  `tools/plugins/sync-plugin-skills.sh --apply`; do not hand-edit plugin skill
  copies.
