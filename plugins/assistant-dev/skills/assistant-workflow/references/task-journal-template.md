# Task Journal Template

Write to `{agent_state_dir}/task.md` in the project root when a local state directory is configured and policy allows. If none is safe, keep the same content in the response/plan packet. This framework-owned ignored artifact is the task source of truth, survives compression/continuation when persisted, and may be updated by the orchestrator.

## When to create
- When `workflow_state_mode=journal`: during Discover before the first wait,
  delegation handoff, cross-session/compaction boundary, or strict/harness/QA gate
- Clarification waits use journal mode when local state is available and allowed;
  otherwise carry the same state inline before waiting
- Medium+ size alone does not require a task journal; `workflow_state_mode=inline`
  keeps the approved plan and evidence in the active packet

## When to update
- When clarification questions are asked, answered, or resolved via explicit `defaults`
- After each Build step: Progress, Artifact Registry, Milestones
- After key decisions, new user constraints, review passes, verification summary, or user review feedback
- After harness-capable events, Pivot/Restart Decisions, typed artifact refs, or QA results when applicable
- During Document, after lesson-bearing evidence is checked when
  `learning_capture_mode=required` or auto activates

## Agent Dispatch Log
[subagent evidence required by completion gates]
- Required roles: Code Writer, Builder/Tester, Code Reviewer; QA Evaluator when required; Code Mapper/Explorer/Architect by size/risk; Reviewer for legacy compatibility.
- Execution mode: delegated | direct_fallback | not_applicable
- Native dispatch evidence: delegated roles reference the agent id, task name, thread, or tool result exposed by the runtime and bind it to this journal's `Created:` identity. Hook lifecycle events record this value as `task_created` when the journal is available; completion accepts a Start and Stop only when both have the current identity and the same non-empty `agent_id` for the required role.
- Routing configuration evidence: each native dispatch records `route_id`, `agent_name`, and its `agent_routing_plan` before invocation. Validate the route/agent pair and its requested copies against the canonical Route policy in `references/subagent-dispatch.md`. Record requested `model`/`reasoning_effort` separately from the runtime-confirmed `effective_configuration`; a requested static profile is not evidence of runtime configuration. Use `unavailable` with evidence when an override is absent or rejected, and do not leave `pending_runtime_confirmation` at a completion gate.
- Title evidence: record `title_metadata` for the top-level task and every native subagent dispatch. Requested title text is intent only; retain `pending_runtime_confirmation` or record `unavailable` until native title API or runtime/tool evidence supports an effective title.
- Direct fallback reason: [authorization_denied | subagents_unavailable | policy_disallowed | N/A]
- Evidence shorthand: delegated refs | role-equivalent direct evidence | N/A only when role not required.
- Code Mapper dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | direct evidence | N/A]
- Explorer dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | direct evidence | N/A]
- Architect dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | direct evidence | N/A]
- Code Writer dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | direct evidence | N/A]
- Builder/Tester dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | direct evidence | N/A]
- Code Reviewer dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated refs | Code Reviewer direct evidence | Reviewer legacy compatibility | N/A]
- Reviewer dispatch/result/direct evidence: [compatibility refs/direct evidence when used | N/A]
- QA Evaluator dispatch/result/direct evidence: [delegated QA refs | direct evidence | N/A when not required]
- Per-slice dispatch evidence: [medium+ delegated slice_id -> Code Writer + Builder/Tester refs; otherwise N/A: reason]

## Slice Verification Ledger
[required for medium+ tasks; update after each slice before starting the next]
do not start the next slice until the current one is `VERIFIED`
| Slice | Task Packet | RED Status | Implementation Status | Verification Command/Result | Criteria Checked | Self-Check Result | Final Status |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| S1: [slice_id] [name] | [packet id] | [pass/fail/N/A] | [done/blocked] | `[command]` → [pass/fail + signal] | [X/Y passed] | [pass/fail + note] | [VERIFIED/BLOCKED] |

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** during Discover only when `workflow_state_mode=journal`; otherwise keep state inline.
2. **Triage** records task/risk/gates/agents/subagent fields before leaving Triage; re-triage if evidence changes them.
3. **Clarification** caps are maximums, not quotas. Waiting state stays `DISCOVERING`; explicit answers clear unresolved topics, while explicit `defaults` also sets `Clarification defaults applied: true`.
4. **Decompose/Plan** persists the slice manifest for medium+ work, captures approval, then updates `Plan approval`.
5. **Build** updates Progress, Artifact Registry, Key Decisions, Status, triggered harness refs, Milestones, and Slice Verification Ledger before the next slice.
6. **Review** runs Spec Review, then Quality Review, fixing/re-testing/re-reviewing until clean or routed by Pivot/Restart; fill Final Result.
7. **Document/Handoff** fills Verification Summary, conditional Manual Verification Result, Review Notes, and Learning Controller only when its mode/evidence activates.
8. **Done** sets `Status: DONE`, records only evidence-backed durable lessons when allowed, and leaves the ignored state file unless cleanup is requested.

## Rules

- Keep entries concise — this is a log, not documentation
- Resume from clarification waits only on explicit numbered answers or explicit `defaults`
- Constraints are checked before each Build step
- Producer roles update Artifact Reference Ledger entries in `references/task-journal-harness-appendix.md` when they create or move artifacts; Consumer roles validate `schema_or_contract` and update `validation_status` before using them
- Pivot/Restart Decisions are append-only recovery records. If the selected action changes scope, files, behavior, risk, verification, or acceptance criteria, record `reapproval_required: true` and wait for approval before continuing.
- On context continuation: read the configured task journal FIRST when it exists, before any other action
- Never delete constraints unless the user explicitly removes them
- The Replay Packet in `references/task-journal-harness-appendix.md` replaces context-handoff templates during active harness work
